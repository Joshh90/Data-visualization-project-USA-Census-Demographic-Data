# Data visualization project-USA Census Demographic Data
## Description
As a BI analyst, I decided to analyze US census demographic data sourced from
Kaggle dataset, which includes comprehensive census data for all counties in 2015.
This analysis aims to answer several key questions regarding transportation, income,
poverty, and employment across the United States.
### About dataset
The data was taken from the DP03 and DP05 tables of the 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates.
The project data file:
_acs2015_county_data.csv: Data for each county or county equivalent in the US, including DC and Puerto Rico._
