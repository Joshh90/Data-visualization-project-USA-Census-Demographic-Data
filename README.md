# Data visualization project-USA Census Demographic Data
## Description
As a BI analyst, I decided to analyze US census demographic data sourced from
Kaggle dataset, which includes comprehensive census data for all counties in 2015.
This analysis aims to answer several key questions regarding transportation, income,
poverty, and employment across the United States.
### About dataset
The data was taken from the DP03 and DP05 tables of the 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates.
The project data file:
_acs2015_county_data.csv: Data for each county or county equivalent in the US, including DC and Puerto Rico._

### Visualization tool used
#### Tableau
Tableau is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that allows users to analyze and visualize data interactively. It is widely used to turn raw data into actionable insights through visually appealing dashboards and reports.

#### First visualization report
##### Question addressed with the data:
_How many people are employed in each state? What is the category of employment? And in
which percentage?_

B. Summary
California has the highest number of employed individuals, totaling 17,246,360.

C. Design
Chart Type:
* I used a symbol map to illustrate the state with the highest employment. Symbol
maps effectively convey geographic distributions of employment data.
Color:
* A blue-orange divergent color palette was employed, with the brightest orange
representing the state with the highest employment and the brightest blue for the
lowest.
Size Mark:
* The largest circle on the map indicates the state with the highest employment.
Tooltip:
* Tooltips provide a breakdown of employment categories within each state.
Filter:
* Filters enhance interactivity, allowing users to focus on specific states or regions.
Visual Summary:
After the thorough analysis of the census dataset, I gained a valuable insight about
employment across the United States.
